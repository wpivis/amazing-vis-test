# Instructions

Thank you for participating in the expert panel for our project! Your task is to look through a set of multiple-choice items and answer some questions about each item (e.g., how clear are the question statement and options?) using the rubric we provide.

Before you start your task, please read the background information below about the multiple-choice items.

## Information about the Multiple-Choice Items

We created multiple-choice items to measure people’s ability to accomplish different visualization tasks. Each multiple-choice item is characterized by three variables: context, chart type, and visualization task. Each item has only one best option. Below are the lists of these three variables used in our project.

**Context (9):**

- health
- population and demography
- energy and environment
- weather and climate
- food and agriculture
- economy
- politics
- education
- innovation

**Chart Type (12):**

- line chart
- bar chart
- stacked bar chart
- 100% stacked bar chart
- area chart
- stacked area chart
- scatterplot
- bubble chart
- pie chart
- histogram
- choropleth map
- tree map

**Visualization Task (13):**

- make comparisons (compare the magnitude of two values)
- retrieve value (identify what the value is based on a description of the value)
- locate value (identify where the value is based on a description of the value)
- identify range (identify the minimum and maximum values of the data)
- identify labels of scales (scales include axes and legends)
- describe the topic of the visualization
- estimate a derived value
  - estimate the difference between two values of the same type
  - estimate the proportion of one value to another value of the same type
  - estimate the average of multiple values of the same type
- describe trend or correlation
- describe the characteristics of an alternative chart type (describe what the visualization would look like if presented in a different chart type)
- judge which visualization design is more appropriate for a task
- judge which task this visualization design best supports

**Below are two examples of such multiple-choice items.**

**Context:** health

**Chart type:** bar chart

**Visualization Task:** locate value

### Example 2:

**Context:** economy

**Chart type:** pie chart

**Visualization Task:** judge which task this visualization design best supports

## Evaluation Instructions

You will use the rubric below to evaluate a randomly selected, representative subset of items from our bank. For each item, please answer each question on the rubric to provide your evaluation of the item. You are welcome to leave additional comments for each item as well.

**Rubric:**

| Rubric Item | Options | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Relevance | Scale 1-4: 1 = not relevant, 4 = highly relevant | How relevant is this item to assess people’s ability to carry out the visualization task associated with the item? |
| Clarity | Scale 1-4: 1 = not clear, 4 = very clear | How clear are the question statement and the options? |
| Answerable | Yes/No | Is one of the options a correct or approximately correct answer to the question? |
| Correctness | Yes/No/More than one option could be considered correct | Is the answer marked green the correct answer? |
