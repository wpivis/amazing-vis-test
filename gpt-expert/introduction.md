# Introduction

We are developing a new assessment to measure people's ability to read charts.
We would like to invite you to evaluate the quality of the questions in this assessment.

The assessment contains X multiple-choice questions about Y data
visualizations. For each question, you will be given a static data
visualization, options and the correct answer. You will be asked to evaluate the quality of each question.
